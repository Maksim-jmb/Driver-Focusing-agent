# Focusing-Main-Char-agent

kind of a generic agent - kept it seperate, but i do use it with Teams agent     

allows for switching main/driver and swapping back to them without using hotkeys for whoever the main is     
replaced some other means i was using to get back to the main in other agents

trying to get something to act like FTL - so i could switch mains/character without having to use/remember/setup 5 sets of keys for a 5 man group     
wanted the ability to main anyone in the group with minimal keys: 1 key to set main, 1 key to swap to main     

1st key: "Num 0" in my case - sets whatever character is in focus
*  "Num 0" in my case is also tied to /ema-team iammaster all, /ema-follow me all, /console autointeract 0
*  I hit "Num 0" whenever i switch characters - so setting is pretty automatic without thinking about it

2nd key: "Alt+F1" could be anything, easy acces key if you need to get back to the main while in RR for movement, etc...     

I have a 3rd key - used to swap layouts, might not be applicable if you aren't using an agent with dxNothing in it - and some other things
*  but if you do, it will kick you out of RR layout back to Vfx layout, disable RR, and focus whoever the main is
*  depending on your relaygroups - i use "party", you might have to change it to get it to work for you

quick thought...if you were just using basic windows layouts - you could modify the 3rd key to match the 2nd and leave in RR disable     
would allow you to disable RR and return to the main from whoever RR is on
